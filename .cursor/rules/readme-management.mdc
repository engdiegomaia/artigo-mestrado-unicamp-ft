# README Management and Context Awareness

## Core Principle
Always maintain the [README.md](mdc:README.md) as the central reference document for project context and progress tracking.

## Workflow Rules

### Before Every Task:
1. **Read the README.md** to understand current project status
2. **Review recent changes** documented in the changelog section
3. **Understand project context** and current phase
4. **Check dependencies** and prerequisites listed

### During Task Execution:
- **Reference project structure** defined in README
- **Follow established patterns** and conventions
- **Maintain consistency** with documented approach
- **Consider impact** on overall project timeline

### After Every Task:
1. **Update README.md** with changes made
2. **Document new features** or modifications
3. **Update progress tracking** sections
4. **Reflect current project state** accurately
5. **Add relevant notes** for future reference

## README Content Structure

The README.md should always contain:
- **Project Overview**: Current focus and objectives
- **Current Status**: What stage/etapa is active
- **Recent Changes**: Log of latest modifications
- **Next Steps**: Upcoming tasks and milestones
- **File Structure**: Organization of project files
- **Usage Instructions**: How to work with the project

## Context Preservation

### Project Memory:
- Each task should build upon previous work
- README serves as project memory and continuity
- Changes should be incremental and documented
- Context should never be lost between sessions

### Status Tracking:
- Current etapa (stage) progress
- Completed milestones
- Pending tasks and deadlines
- Important decisions and rationale

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start every response** by checking README context
2. **End every significant task** by updating README
3. **Keep README current** and accurate
4. **Use README as source of truth** for project state
5. **Document all major changes** with timestamps

This ensures continuous project awareness and proper documentation throughout the dissertation development process.
