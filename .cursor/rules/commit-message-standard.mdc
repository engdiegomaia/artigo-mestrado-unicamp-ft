# Commit Message Standard

## Core Principles
- Every task/change must have a clear, descriptive commit message.

## Commit Message Format
Use one of the following formats:

```
feat: [short description]
fix: [short description]
docs: [short description]
refactor: [short description]
```

### Examples:
- feat: add user authentication
- fix: correct typo in README
- docs: update API documentation
- refactor: improve error handling
